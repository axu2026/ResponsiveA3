# Assignment 3: Responsive Screen
This app is for assignment 3 of CS 501 E1, showing an example of a responsive screen. In this case it is a mock email application that lacks functionality at the moment.

The app is set within a BoxWithConstraints which checks the maxWidth of the screen. If the screen is larger than a certain amount, it switches to a tablet sized composable. The phone and tablet composables differ in structure, with the phone being just a Column, and the tablet being a Row with two panels, a navigation panel and an inbox panel.

# AI Disclosure
ChatGPT was used for help with setting up some of the contraint values for switching between phone and tablet.
